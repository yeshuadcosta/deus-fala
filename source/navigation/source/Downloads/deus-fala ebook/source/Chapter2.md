### The Nicene Creed

(I / We) believe in One God The Father almighty, maker of Heaven and
Earth of all that is visible and invisible. (I / We) believe in One Lord, Jesus
Christ, The Only begotten Son of God, born of the Father before all ages.
God from God, Light from Light, True God from True God, begotten, not
made, consubstantial with the Father. Through Him, all things were made.
For us men and for Our Salvation, He came down from Heaven: and by
the Holy Spirit was incarnate of the Virgin Mary, and became Man. For
Our Sake, He was crucified under Pontius Pilate; He suffered, died and was
buried. On the third day, He rose again in fulfilment of the Scriptures: He
ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father. He will
come again in glory to judge the living and the dead and His kingdom will
have no end. (I / We) believe in the Holy Spirit, The Lord, the giver of Life,
who proceeds from the Father and the Son. With the Father and the Son, He
is worshipped and glorified. He has spoken through the Prophets. (I / We)
believe in One Holy Catholic and apostolic Church. (I / We) acknowledge
one baptism for the forgiveness of sins. (I / We) look for the resurrection of
the dead, and the life of the world to come.<br>
**Amen.**

### The Our Father

Our Father who art in Heaven Hallowed be thy name, Thy Kingdom come;
Thy will be done on Earth as it in Heaven Give Us this day Our Daily Bread
And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us
and lead us not Into temptation but deliver from all evil.<br>
**Amen.**
