	<h1>EPHESIANS 6:10-20</h1>
	<h2>The Whole Armour of God</h2>

<p>
Finally, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of His power.<br>
Put on the whole armour of God, so that you may be able to <br>
stand against the wiles of the devil. For our struggle is not against <br>
enemies of blood and flesh, but against the rulers, against the <br>
authorities, against the cosmic powers of this present darkness,<br>
against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places. <br>
Therefore take up the whole armour of God, so that you may be <br>
able to withstand on that evil day, and having done everything,<br>
to stand firm. Stand therefore, and fasten the belt of truth <br>
around your waist, and put on the breastplate of righteousness.<br>
As shoes for your feet put on whatever will make you ready to <br>
proclaim the gospel of peace. With all of these, take the shield<br>
of faith, with which you will be able to quench all the flaming <br>
arrows of the evil one. Take the helmet of salvation, and the <br>
sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. Pray in the Spirit<br>
at all times in every prayer supplication. To that end keep alert<br>
and always persevere in supplication for all the saints. Pray also<br>
for me, so that when I speak, a message may be given to me to<br>
make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel, for which<br>
I am an ambassador in chains. Pray that I may declare it boldly,<br>
as I must speak.<br>
AMEN
