<p>Let us Pray:</p>

	<p>
	Pour forth, we beseech Thee, O Lord, <br>
	Thy grace into our hearts; that we, <br>
	to whom the incarnation of Christ, Thy Son,<br>
	was made known by the message of an angel,<br>
	may by His Passion and Cross be brought to <br>
	the glory of His Resurrection, through <br>
	the same Christ Our Lord.<br>
	Amen.
