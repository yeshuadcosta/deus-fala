	<h1>THE MEMORARE</h1>
	<h2>Intercession To Our Lady</h2>

	<p>
	Hail, holy Queen, Mother of mercy, our life, hail our sweetness<br>
	and our hope. To thee do we cry, poor banished children of Eve.<br>
	To thee do we send up our sighs, mourning and weeping in this<br>
	valley of tears. Turn, then, most gracious advocate, thine eyes<br>
	of mercy toward us, and after this, our exile, show unto<br>
	us the blessed fruit of thy womb, Jesus. O clement,<br>
	O loving, O sweet Virgin Mary.
	</p>

	<br></br>

<p>	V. Pray for us, O holy Mother of God.<br>
	R. That we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ.<br>
	AMEN
