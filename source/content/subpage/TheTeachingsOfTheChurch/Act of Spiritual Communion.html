	<h1>ACT OF SPIRITUAL COMMUNION</h1>

	<p>
	My Jesus, I believe that You are truly present in<br>
	the most Holy Sacrament. I Love You above<br>
	all things and I desire to recive You <br>
	into my Soul. Since I cannot recieve you<br>
	Sacramentally, come at least spiritually<br>
	into my Heart. I embrace You as if You were<br>
	already there and Unite nyself wholly to You.<br>
	Never permit me to be separated from You <br>
	AMEN
	</p>
