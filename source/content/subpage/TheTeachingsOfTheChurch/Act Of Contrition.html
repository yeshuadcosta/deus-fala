	<h1>ACT OF CONTRITION</h1>
	<h2>Prayer for Confession</h2>

	<p>
	 O my God, I am sorry and beg pardon for all my Sins, and detest them above all things,<br>
	 because they deserve Your dreadful punishment, because they have crucified my loving Saviour<br>
	 Jesus Christ, and most of all, because they offend Your Infinite Goodness, and I firmly resolve,<br>
	 by the help of Your grace, never to offend You again, and carefully to avoid the occasion of Sin<br>
	 AMEN
	</p>

	 <p>OR</p>

	 <p>
	 O my God, I am heartily sorry for all my sins. Because of them I deserve the eternal pains of hell<br>
	 but most of all because I have offended thee my God who art all-good and deserving of my Love. <br>
	 I firmly resolve with the help of Thy grace to confess my sins, to do penance, to avoid the <br>
	 proximate ocassion of sin and never to sink anymore.<br>
	 AMEN
	 </p>
