	<h1>THE NICENE CREED</h1>

	<p>
	(I / We) believe in One God<br>
	The Father almighty, maker of Heaven<br>
	and Earth of all that is visible and<br>
	invisible. (I / We) believe in One Lord,<br>
	Jesus Christ, The Only begotten Son of God,<br>
	born of the Father before all ages. God<br>
	from God, Light from Light, True God from<br>
	True God, begotten, not made,<br>
	consubstantial with the Father.<br>
	Through Him, all things were made.<br>
	For us men and for Our Salvation,<br>
	He came down from Heaven: and by the<br>
	Holy Spirit was incarnate of the Virgin<br>
	Mary, and became Man. For Our Sake,<br>
	He was crucified under Pontius Pilate;<br>
	He suffered, died and was buried.<br>
	On the third day, He rose again in<br>
	fullfilment of the Scriptures:<br>
	He ascended into heaven and is seated<br>
	at the right hand of the Father.<br>
	He will come again in glory to judge<br>
	the living and the dead and His kingdom<br>
	will have no end. (I / We) believe in<br>
	the Holy Spirit, The Lord, the giver<br>
	of Life, who proceeds from the Father<br>
	and the Son. With the Father and the Son,<br>
	He is worshipped and glorified.<br>
	He has spoken through the Prophets.<br>
	(I / We) believe in One Holy Catholic and<br>
	apostolic Church. (I / We) acknowledge one<br>
	baptism for the forgiveness of sins.<br>
	(I / We) look for the resurrection of the dead,<br>
	and the life of the world to come.<br>
	Amen
