	<h1>Psalm 91</h1>
	<h2>Prayer for Protection</h2>

<p>
Whoever goes to The Lord for Safety<br>
Whoever remains in the Protection of The<br>
Almighty, can say to Him,"You Are My Lord,<br>
You are My God, In You I Trust."<br>
He will keep safe from all hidden Dangers<br>
and all deadly diseases, You will be safe<br>
in His care, His Faithfulness will<br>
Protect and Defend You, You need not<br>
fear any Dangers at Night or Sudden<br>
Attacks during The Day or the Plagues<br>
that strike in the Dark or The Evils<br>
that kill in Daylight. A Thousand<br>
may fall beside You, Ten Thousand<br>
all around You, and You will not be<br>
harmed, God will put His Angels <br>
In Charge Of You and Keep You from<br>
hurting yout feet on the Stones,<br>
You will trample down Lions and<br>
Snakes, Fierce Lions and Poisonous<br>
Snakes but you will not be harmed.<br>
God Says,"I will save those <br>
who Love me and Protect Those who<br>
acknowledge me as God, When they call<br>
to me, I will Answer them. When they are<br>
in Trouble, I will be with Them,<br>
I will rescue them and Honour Them,<br>
I will reward them with Long Life,<br>
And I will Save Them."<br>
AMEN
