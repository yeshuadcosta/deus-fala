	<h1>PSALM 51</h1>
	<h2>Prayer for Forgiveness from God</h2>

<p>
Have mercy on me, O God, according to your steadfast love;<br>
according to your abundant mercy blot out my transgressions.<br>
Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin.<br>
For I know my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me.<br>
Against you, you alone, have I sinned, and done what is evil<br>
in your sight, so that you are justified in your sentence and<br>
blameless when you pass judgment. Indeed, I was born guilty,<br>
a sinner when my mother conceived me. You desire truth in the<br>
inward being; therefore teach me wisdom in my secret heart.<br>
Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean;  wash me, and I shall<br>
be whiter than snow. Let me hear joy and gladness;  let the bones<br>
that you have crushed rejoice, Hide your face from my sins, and<br>
blot out all my iniquities. Create in me a clean heart, O God,<br>
and put a new and right spirit within me. Do not cast me away<br>
from your presence,and do not take your holy spirit from me.<br>
Restore to me the joy of your salvation, and sustain in me a <br>
willing spirit. Then I will teach transgressors your ways,<br>
and sinners will return to you. Deliver me from bloodshed, O God,<br>
O God of my salvation, and my tongue will sing aloud of yourM<br>
deliverance. Lord, open my lips, and my mouth will declare your <br>
praise. For you have no delight in sacrifice; if I were to give<br>
a burnt offering, you would not be pleased. The sacrifice acceptable<br>
to God is a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart, O God,<br>
you will not despise. Do good to Zion in Your Good Pleasure,<br>
Rebuild the walls of Jerusalem, then you will delight in Right<br>
Sacrifices, Burnt Offerings and Whole Burnt Offerings and 
Then bulls will be offered on Your Altar.<br>
AMEN
