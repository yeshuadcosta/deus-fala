	<h1>THE APOSTLE'S CREED</h1>
	<h2>The Proffesion Of Our Faith</h2>

	<p>
	I believe in God, The Father almighty,<br>
	creator of Heaven and Earth<br>
	I believe in Jesus Christ,<br>
	His Only Son, Our Lord Who was<br>
	conceived by the Power of The<br>
	Holy Spirit, Born of The Virgin<br>
	Mary, Suffered on the Pontius<br>
	Pilate, Was Crucified, Died,<br>
	and was Buried. He descended<br>
	into Hell And on the third day,<br>
	he rose again from the Dead<br>
	He was seated at the right hand<br>
	of God: The Father Almighty<br>
	He will come again to judge<br>
	The Living and the Dead<br>
	I believe in the Holy Spirit<br>
	The Holy Catholic Church<br>
	The Communion Of Saints<br>
	The Forgiveness of Saints<br>
	The Resurrection of Body And <br>
	Life everlasting<br>
	Amen
