	Remember the Most Gracious Virgin Mary<br>
	That never was it known that anyone who<br>

	O Mother of The Word Incarnate<br>
	Despise not my Petition<br>
	But in Your Mercy Hear and Answer Me.<br>
	Amen
	</p>
		
	<p>
	V. O Mary conceived without sin.<br>
	R. Pray for Us who recourse to Thee<br>
	Amen
