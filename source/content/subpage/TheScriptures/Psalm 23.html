	<h1>PSALM 23</h1>

<p>
The Lord is My shepherd and I shall not be in want<br>
He makes me lie down in Green Pastures and restores<br>
my soul and guides me in parts of righteousness, for His <br>
Name Sake. Even though I walk in the valley in the shallow <br>
of death. I will fear no evil, for You O Lord are always with me.<br>
Your Rod and Your staff, they comfort me. You prepare a<br>
table before me in the presence of my enemies;<br>
You annoint my head with oil and my cup overflows,<br>
Surely Goodness and Love will follow me, all the Days of my Life<br>
And I will dwell in the House of Lord forever.<br>
AMEN
